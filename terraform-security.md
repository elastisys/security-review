# Terraform Security

1. Are you storing your Terraform Code in a version control system (Git or similar)?
1. Are you using one Terraform workspace for each environment of a given infrastructure component?
1. Are you using Terraform modules to increase reusability of your infrastructure code?
1. Is your Terraform integrated with a secret management tool (HashiCorpâ€™s Vault or similar)?
1. Is your Terraform state file encrypted at rest?
1. Are you using Terraform Cloud?
    1. How are you running it? SaaS hosted by HashiCorp or a private instance?
    1. Did you assign Terraform Cloud workspace ownership and permissions to your teams?
    1. Did you restrict the Non-Terraform access to cloud provider UIs and APIs to avoid manual infrastructure modifications?
